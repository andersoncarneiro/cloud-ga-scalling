# Managing reliability and computational resources using Genetic Algorithms


This project simulates cloud service auto scaling with different traffic patterns and uses genetic algorithms to create optimal scaling decisions. The simulation evaluates strategies based on response time, VM utilization, and SLO compliance.


## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the notebook:**
   - Launch Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open `simulation.ipynb` in Jupyter 
   - Run cells sequentially to see simulation results

3. **Run tests:**
   ```
   python -m unittest test_cloud_simulation.py
   ```
